# XTB Charts

Offline-first OHLC candlestick charts for a curated list of XTB instruments
(stocks / ETF / ETC), with price data sourced from Yahoo Finance and stored
locally in SQLite. A ground-up rebuild of [`xtb-trading`](../xtb-trading),
planned and tracked with [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) (see `openspec/`).

**The data is always offline.** Nothing is fetched because you opened a chart.
A sync happens only when you ask for one — a button in the dev UI, a periodic
refresh you switch on for the current session, the sync CLI, a manually
dispatched release workflow, or the release workflow's daily 12:00 UTC schedule
(which keeps the published site fresh without anyone touching GitHub). If the
data looks stale, the answer is a sync, never an implicit fetch.

## Quick start (dev mode)

```bash
uv sync
uv run xtb-charts serve          # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Open the app and press **Sync all** to populate the database. Run the tests
with:

```bash

```

## Two modes, one frontend

The frontend reads a static-friendly JSON contract (`data/meta.json`,
`data/catalog.json`, `data/candles/<symbol>/<timeframe>.json`) and behaves the
same wherever those files come from:

- **Dev mode** — `uv run xtb-charts serve`: FastAPI serves the contract
  dynamically from SQLite and adds the sync endpoints. Sync controls visible.
- **Static mode** — the exporter writes the same shapes to `dist/`; any static
  file server can host the result. Sync controls absent. This is exactly what
  GitHub Pages serves.

## Timeframes and fetch depth

**How deep a sync fetches** is a fixed property of the timeframe, not something
a run tunes. There is no bar target to set: on three of the four timeframes the
answer is already "everything the source has".

| Timeframe | Yahoo interval | Initial backfill | Note |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| M15       | `15m`          | up to 1,200 bars | Yahoo caps `15m` at 60 days, which usually binds first; older gaps are permanent |
| H1        | `1h`           | as deep as served | Yahoo caps `1h` at ~730 days |
| D1        | `1d`           | full history      | uncapped by the source |
| W1        | `1wk`          | full history      | uncapped by the source |

**Storage is append-only.** A sync adds bars and overwrites bars it re-fetched;
it never deletes one. A series therefore only grows, keeps history the source
will no longer serve, and may reach further back than the fetch window above.
Sync M15 at least every 60 days or it develops gaps that can never be
backfilled — the other timeframes always backfill.

A repeat sync requests only from just before the newest stored bar, so its cost
does not grow with how deep the series has become. `--full` re-pulls each
timeframe's whole fetch window; bars older than that window survive it.

## Chart display limit and default zoom

How much is *available* to pan across is separate from how much is *visible* at
once, and from how much is fetched.

The **bars** field in the toolbar bounds availability: a positive whole number or
the word `all`, defaulting to the 5,000 most recent bars on every timeframe.
Changing it re-slices the bars already in the browser — there is no refetch, and
a lower limit does not make the page load faster (the limit bounds drawing, not
downloading). Zero, a negative number, and anything that is not a number are
refused, leaving the previous limit in force. Because a measurement's anchors
may fall outside the new view, changing the limit discards a drawn measurement.

**Zoom** bounds visibility: whenever a series is presented afresh — selecting an
instrument, switching timeframe, changing the display limit, or reloading after a
sync — the chart frames the 200 most recent bars of the displayed slice rather
than fitting the whole slice. A series with 200 bars or fewer is shown in full.
Zoom is not persisted across reloads.

The **Latest** button in the toolbar scrolls back to the newest bar without
changing the current zoom. It reads only bars already in memory and never
triggers a fetch.

### What the browser remembers

Settings are stored per browser under a single `localStorage` key and restored
on the next load: display limit, selected instrument, selected timeframe,
enabled indicators, and the sidebar filters (search text, asset class,
compatible-only). Anything that no longer resolves — a renamed instrument, an
unknown timeframe — falls back to its default without disturbing the rest, and
a browser that denies storage just runs on defaults.

Sync state is deliberately excluded, so a reload can never resume fetching:
**full refresh** and **auto 15m** both come back off. Measurements and zoom
position are not restored either — the restored instrument and timeframe open on
the default 200-bar framing instead. None of this travels with the exported data.

## Periodic refresh (dev mode only)

The **auto 15m** checkbox next to the sync buttons runs an incremental sync
every 15 minutes for as long as it is on. It is off by default, authorizes
refreshes for the current session only — a reload always turns it off — and a
tick that lands while a sync is running is dropped rather than queued. It does
not exist on the published site, which has no backend to sync with.

Each refresh skips any symbol/timeframe where less than one bar's duration has
passed since its newest stored bar, because the source cannot yet have a bar
that is not already held: W1 is left alone for seven days, D1 for 24 hours, so
in practice only M15 and H1 do any work. A skipped timeframe keeps the
freshness of the last run that actually fetched it. Pressing a sync button
always fetches everything — the rule applies to periodic runs only.

## Indicators

Indicators are computed client-side in JavaScript from the bars on the chart
and toggle individually — no server, so they work identically on the static
site. Both are ports of MQL5 indicators with their signal-parity conventions
preserved, and both scan the whole displayed series so every detected zone is
visible at once. Raising the display limit deepens the scan; setting it below an
indicator's warm-up produces the insufficient-history warning rather than a
silently empty chart, even when far more bars are stored.

**FVG** is a Fair Value Gap scanner ported from `FVGSignal.mq5`. Two deliberate
deviations from that source, recorded in the file header and the indicators
spec:

- The recent-bars scan cap is dropped, so every detected zone is visible deep in
  history.
- Displacement rules (body dominance, bar3's wick limit, the gap-vs-bar2-range
  ratio) read **close-to-open-spaces**: when two same-type bars are adjacent and
  the later opens beyond the earlier's close, the move from the previous close
  to this close is credited to the later bar's body and range. The gap, zone
  edges, and drawing still use recorded OHLC.

Golden fixtures under `tests/fixtures/fvg/` come from the Python reference and
prove numeric conventions (EMA seeding, stochastic, warm-up warning). Space
behaviour is covered separately by hand-checked cases in
`tests/fixtures/fvg-spaces/`.

**OB** is an Order Block scanner ported from `SMCTrading.mq5` v3.23
(sha256 `484d821d…`). It marks the last opposing candle before an impulse that
broke structure: **demand zones only** are drawn in green, each labelled `OB`.
Supply zones are still detected internally for MT5 parity but are not rendered.
They rest on a full internal port of the source's swing-pivot detection,
points-based confirmation, structural break tracking and impulse/pullback
classification, none of which is rendered. The source's slow-RSI block is not
ported at all — it is dead code there, computed but never read.

Six deliberate deviations from `SMCTrading.mq5`, recorded in `OB_PARAMS`:

- The lookback cap is dropped, so zones stay visible deep in history.
- Every detected **demand** zone is drawn, matching the source's history mode
  rather than its live view, which hides counter-trend zones and all but the
  newest swing. There is no show-history switch — full history is always on.
- Supply zones are detected but never drawn (rendering deviation only).
- The newest stored bar stands in for MT5's forming bar and never becomes a zone
  or a confirmed pivot, the same convention FVG follows.
- The skip-bar interval is dropped: the source refuses pivots on bars opening in
  a server-time window below H4, while this port takes **every bar as real
  data**. Parity is therefore claimed only at H4 and above, where that filter is
  inert in the source; on m15 and h1 the two read different bar sets and their
  zones can legitimately differ.
- Only the source's fresh-load path is reproduced; incremental per-bar
  refinements are not modelled.

### Regenerating the OB fixtures

Unlike FVG there is no Python reference implementation, so MT5 itself is the
oracle and the fixtures come from a running terminal:

1. Open a chart at H4 or above (D1 is the verified case) in the MT5 install used
   for testing, attach `SMCTrading` with `InpShowHistory = true`, and force a
   full recalculation by reloading the indicator or switching timeframe and back.
   The port reconstructs the series in one pass, which matches MT5's recalculated
   state rather than the state a long-running chart accumulates.
2. Run the `ExportOBOracle` script on that chart. It writes `bars_`, `pivots_`,
   `zones_` and `meta_` CSVs to `MQL5/Files/ob_oracle/`. Its source lives at
   `tools/mql5/ExportOBOracle.mq5`; compile it from a path without spaces, since
   MetaEditor's `/compile:` flag fails silently on spaces.
3. `uv run python tools/generate_ob_fixtures.py` turns those CSVs into
   `tests/fixtures/ob/`, taking the point size from the `meta_` export because
   the confirmation distance is measured in points.
4. `node tests/js/run_ob_fixtures.mjs` compares the pivot sequence first and
   only then the zones, so a structural divergence is reported as structural
   instead of surfacing as a handful of misplaced rectangles.

### Regenerating the MACD fixtures

Like OB, MT5 is the oracle. `SimpleMACD` must be configured 13/34/9 on typical
price — the export script passes `PRICE_TYPICAL` into `iCustom`.

1. Open **XAUUSD D1** in MT5-Testing and run the `ExportMacdOracle` script on
   that chart. It writes JSON to `MQL5/Files/macd_oracle/`. Source:
   `tools/mql5/ExportMacdOracle.mq5` (compile via MetaEditor only when the
   source changes).
2. `uv run python tools/copy_macd_fixture.py` copies the JSON into
   `tests/fixtures/macd/`.
3. `node tests/js/run_macd_fixtures.mjs` compares main, signal and histogram
   arrays value by value.

## Releasing to GitHub Pages

`main` is development. A release is a GitHub Actions workflow — dispatched
manually or fired daily at **12:00 UTC** — that restores the previous
`market.db` snapshot from the `data` branch, runs an incremental sync, commits
the snapshot back, exports the static site, and deploys it to Pages. Each run
does this unconditionally, even when no code changed, so the published snapshot
stays fresh. Data is never re-pulled from scratch on a normal run, and no
release drops bars the snapshot already holds.

Manual dispatch carries one choice, **full refresh**; scheduled runs are always
incremental. There are no bar-target inputs: fetch depth is fixed per
timeframe. Each release exports every stored bar, so the published payload grows
as history accumulates.

The schedule is read from the workflow file on the default branch; the job still
checks out the `release` ref, so a scheduled run never publishes unreleased work
from `main`. GitHub's cron is best-effort and may be delayed. After **60 days
without repository activity**, GitHub disables scheduled workflows — re-enable
them from the Actions tab if the daily release stops firing.

### Rehearse locally first

Every step except the deploy runs the same commands locally:

```bash
uv run xtb-charts sync           # or: sync --full
uv run xtb-charts export         # writes the static site to dist/
python3 -m http.server -d dist 8080
```

Browse <http://127.0.0.1:8080> — that is byte-for-byte the site Pages will
serve.

### Deepening an existing database

A database synced before fetch depth and pruning were separated holds roughly
1,000 bars per timeframe. Nothing breaks: bars are only ever added from here on.
To actually reach the new depth, run **one full refresh per symbol**
(`uv run xtb-charts sync --full`, or a dispatch with full refresh) — a slow,
expected, one-time pull. Until then the app behaves as before, with the display
limit simply exceeding what is stored.

Expect the export to grow accordingly: roughly 3.6 MB before, about 20 MB after
deepening the eight seeded instruments, and larger with each release.

Rolling this change back is **not** symmetric — the restored code prunes to its
target on the next sync and would delete the accumulated history. Copy the
current snapshot aside before reverting.

### Manual snapshot fallback

If Yahoo rate-limits the CI runner, or you would rather do the first long
backfill on your own connection, sync locally and push the snapshot yourself.
The workflow restores whatever the `data` branch holds, so the next dispatch
picks up from your snapshot and syncs incrementally on top of it.

The branch layout is a contract: `data` is a single root commit whose tree
holds exactly one file, `market.db`, **at the root** — not under `data/`.
Committing it the ordinary way (`git add data/market.db`) puts the blob at the
wrong path, and the workflow's restore step then finds nothing and falls back
to a full backfill. These commands write it the way CI does, without touching
your working tree, branches, or `HEAD`:

```bash
uv run xtb-charts sync           # refresh data/market.db locally first
blob=$(git hash-object -w data/market.db)
tree=$(printf '100644 blob %s\tmarket.db\n' "$blob" | git mktree)
commit=$(git commit-tree "$tree" -m "data snapshot $(date -u +%FT%TZ)")
git push --force origin "$commit:refs/heads/data"
```

The force push is deliberate: every snapshot is a fresh root commit, so the
branch keeps one copy of the database rather than accumulating each release's
binary forever. Never merge or rebase `data` into a code branch — it is an
orphan ref holding that single file.

To go the other way and inspect the snapshot CI produced:

```bash
git fetch origin data
git cat-file blob FETCH_HEAD:market.db > data/market.db
```

## Adding a symbol

Account statements exported from XTB live in `data/xtb-reports/` (one or more
`*.xlsx` files, plus optional plain-text shortlists such as `ETFs.txt` and
`STCs.txt`). To see which instruments they name that the catalog does not
yet cover, run:

```bash
uv run python tools/import_xtb_report_symbols.py
```

The tool scans every workbook sheet and every `*.txt` shortlist, deduplicates
tickers, and prints proposed CSV rows for anything missing from
`data/symbols.csv`. It **never writes the catalog** — completing and committing
rows is manual work. The report's Instrument column and the shortlist's
comma-separated hints are maintainer notes, not the verbatim xStation name:
copy `xtb_name` from xStation when filling in a row, because CFD detection
reads that field.

Before enabling a new row, verify its Yahoo ticker returns daily bars:

```bash
uv run python tools/verify_catalog_symbols.py --source candidates
uv run python tools/verify_catalog_symbols.py              # sweep whole catalog
```

Both tools hash `data/symbols.csv` before and after the run and exit non-zero
if the file changed. A candidate whose ticker cannot be confirmed at Yahoo is
not added; record it in the change's `rejected-candidates.md` instead.

Add a row to `data/symbols.csv` and verify the ticker against Yahoo before
enabling it — XTB and Yahoo symbols differ in exchange suffix (`.UK` → `.L`,
`.FR` → `.PA`, `IDR.ES` → `IDR.MC`) and sometimes in ticker root (`TSLA.DE`
is `TL0.DE` on Yahoo). Copy `xtb_name` **verbatim** from xStation: CFD
detection reads that string, and it is the only thing distinguishing
"Alphabet Inc CFD - class A" from "Alphabet Inc - class A".

`point_size` should be the instrument's real tick size, because it sets how many
decimals the chart shows: `0.01` gives two, `0.00001` gives five, everywhere a
price appears (price scale, crosshair, OHLC legend, ruler readout). Claiming a
finer tick than the instrument trades at surfaces floating-point noise — a close
of `296.30` renders as `296.29999`.

The portfolio compatibility flags (non-EUR quote currency, CFD) are warnings,
not blocks — flagged instruments still chart normally.
